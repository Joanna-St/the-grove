# Ideas & Revisits

Things to consider for later phases. Not current phase scope.

---

## Creatures & Resources

- **Interaction-triggered resource drops** — rather than (or in addition to)
  passive drip, clicking a creature could trigger an immediate resource drop
  at that moment. Makes interactions feel purposeful beyond just dialogue and
  bond XP. Revisit when Phase 3 has more creatures contributing simultaneously
  and the passive model starts to feel invisible.

- **Random object drops / event seeds** — blink dog in particular should
  occasionally bring non-resource items (a boot, a coin, a button — noted in
  design doc). These breadcrumbs could seed or unlock visitor events in Phase 4.
  Track as a separate inventory or event-flag list rather than a resource.

## Window & Display

- **Windowed/fullscreen toggle at runtime** — F11 toggle didn't work reliably
  due to SDL2 window repositioning issues on Windows. Currently config-only
  (`"fullscreen": true/false` in config.json, requires restart). Worth
  revisiting in Phase 5 when polishing — may need a pygame._sdl2 approach
  or a launcher settings screen.

- **Custom window icon** — replace the default Pygame icon with something
  grove-themed (a leaf, the Silvanus symbol). Low effort, nice finish.
  Defer to Phase 5 alongside other art tasks.
